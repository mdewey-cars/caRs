#' A function to help users setup `adobeanalyticsr` to work on their machine.

#' This function allows us to simplify away from a lot of the technical details
#' that can sometimes confuse newcomers to adobe analytics. The `adobeanalyticsr`
#' package provides a number of fantastic tools for analysts to pull in data
#' from the adobe analytics workspace, thus making enabling that behavior highly
#' desireable.
